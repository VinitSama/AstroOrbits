<h2> What is Panchang?</h2> 
</div>
<div>
Why Panchang Still Matters In The 21st Century 
</div>
<div>
The term “Panchang” comes from the combination of two Sanskrit words ‘Pancha’ meaning five, and Anga means parts. Together, Panchanaga means the five key elements of a day which determine the astrological significance of the day. When these five angas of a day are considered in consonance, astrologers get immensely valuable scientific sound and spiritually important time periods within a day. Modern day scientific researches on biorhythms, lunar and solar cycles, and planetary effects have further provided interesting insights into the importance of this ancient Indian practice of diving days, weeks, fortnights, months, years the five angas or Panchangs for the human kind..
</div>
<div>
<h2> The Five Angas or Pillars of Panchang</h2>
</div>
<div>
The ancient Indian civilisation has kept numerous secrets and knowledge hidden, and only a few have successfully been deployed to use the good of mankind, and the five angas or the five pillars of the Pachang is just a tip of an iceberg. In the vedic philosophy, the five angas or Daily Panchang Details (Tithi, Nakshatra, Yoga, Karana) of the panchange are as follows: 
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Tithi: Also referred to as the lunar day/date in the modern times, the tithi in the Panchang plays an important role in the determination of important events like marriage, festivals like Holi, Deepawali, Onam, Sankranti, and Jalikattu. A set of 30 lunar days is called Festival and Muhurat Calendar and it is considered to be the carrier of distinct energy, which begins with Amavasya (new moon) to the Purnima (full moon).</li> 	
<li>Vaara: These are basically weekends, which determine the overall nature of the activities for the upcoming days. These activities range from Panchang for Auspicious Timings and Rituals like Paajas, Danas to business and financial activities like investments etc. </li>
<li>Nakshatra (Lunar Constellation): Nakshatra or Planetary Transit and Effects play a crucial role in Indian vedic astrology. There are 27 nakshatras in total, and each Zodiac sign is assigned  three Nakshatras for their granular predictions in the vedic philosophy. For example, Ashvini Nakshatra supports healing, while Revati provides protective energy. These form an integral part of the Daily Panchang 2025 India created by certified vedic astrologers with over 20 years of experience in vedic astrology and numerology. </li>
<li>Yoga (Sun–Moon Combination): There are twenty seven Yogas or sun–moon pairings create combinations which correspond with auspicious or challenging conditions. There are certain yogas which are particularly associated with good fortune and fertility like Choghadiya and Hora Muhurat, Siddha Yoga, and Gaj Kesari Yogas. And at the same time, Panchag also tells us about Rahukaal timings and Yogas around which we have to practice caution. </li>
<li>Karana / Ardha Tithin (Half-Tithi): Eleven half-day segments pinpoint micro-moments for important tasks, refining auspicious timing even further. Examples of such half tithi  in the Moon phase calendar is when a particular festival begins in between a day and extends to another half part of another day. For example, as per Festival Panchang, Ganesha Chaturthi in 2025 began at 1:54 PM on 26 August 2025, and continued till the first half of 27 August 2025.</li>
