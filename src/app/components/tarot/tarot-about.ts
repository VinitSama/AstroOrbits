            <h2>What Tarot Really Is</h2>/Let’s clear something up: tarot isn’t about spooky fortunes or dramatic predictions. It’s more like having a quiet conversation with yourself.
        </div>
        <div>
            You ask a question. You pull a card. And suddenly, something clicks. Not because the card is magic, but because it helps you see something you weren’t seeing before.<br>Here’s how the deck works:
        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>There are 78 cards total</strong>, split into two groups:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Arcana (22 cards)</strong> – These cards deal with big themes: growth, transformation, identity shifts. They show up when something important is happening.</li>
                <li><strong>Minor Arcana (56 cards)</strong> – These focus on the everyday: relationships, thoughts, money, emotions. They’re split into 4 suits:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cups</strong> – Emotions, love, intuition</li>
                        <li><strong>Wands</strong> – Energy, desire, action</li>
                        <li><strong>Swords</strong> – Thoughts, decisions, tension</li>
                        <li><strong>Pentacles</strong> – Work, finances, physical world</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            Each card is a symbol. A spread is a story. And when read with care, it can offer some powerful perspective.
        </div>
        <div>

        <div>Why Everything Stays Free (Our Business Philosophy)</div>
        <div>
            Spiritual guidance shouldn't be a privilege reserved for those who can afford premium rates. That principle drives everything we do at AstroOrbits.
        </div>
        <div>
            Our founding team spent months researching the spiritual services market in India. What we found was disappointing: 
            <ul>
                <li>Either expensive human consultations that many couldn't afford,</li>
                <li>Or "free" websites that delivered generic garbage with hidden upgrade pressures.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            The middle ground – quality spiritual tools accessible to everyone – simply didn't exist.
        </div>
        <div>
            That's where technology became our solution. Instead of replacing human intuition (which we believe is irreplaceable), we focused on making traditional tarot wisdom accessible through sophisticated algorithms. No psychological manipulation, no artificial scarcity, no upgrade pressure.
        </div>
        <div><h2>Our approach combines:</h2></div>
        <div>
            Traditional Tarot Knowledge, Symbolism & Archetypes and Real-Life Relevance: A card isn’t just a symbol, it’s a lens you can apply to your career, relationships, or personal growth. This way, a reading isn’t vague or abstract, it’s something you can carry into your day with meaning.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why People Quietly Turn to Tarot</h3>
            Most people don’t announce they’ve had a tarot reading. And yet, so many do. Not because they’re “into that stuff,” but because sometimes they just need a moment of clarity.
            Some come when:
            <ul>
                <li>They’re stuck in a loop</li>
                <li>They’re standing at a crossroads</li>
                <li>They’ve drifted from themselves</li>
                <li>They’re trying to make sense of what life just threw at the</li>
            <ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            Tarot doesn’t pretend to fix things. But it can help you name what’s going on. And that’s often the first real step forward.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2> Feel the Pull?</h2>
            You don’t have to believe in destiny. You don’t have to understand how tarot “works.” You just need to be open. To reflect. To pause for a moment and check in with yourself.
        </div>
        <div>At AstroOrbits, tarot is quiet, honest, and real.</div>
        <div>
            So if something inside you has been stirring, maybe this is your sign.<br>
            Pull a card. Ask a question. See what shows up.<br>

</div>
<div>
This spread gives you a quiet moment to understand the situation you’re in by looking at it from three points in time: <strong>tarot past present future</strong> i.e, your past, your present, and the direction you’re heading. You start moving towards the solution the moment you start understanding <strong>tarot card meaning</strong>. 

</div>
<div>
<h2> What Each Card Means</h2>
</div>
<div>
The process is simple. You ask your question. You draw three cards. And each one tells part of the story.
 <ol>
<li>The first card looks to the past. It shows what’s behind this situation—what shaped it, what patterns you may still be carrying.</li>
<li>The second card is your present. This card shows us where we stand in our lives at present – it indicates our mindset, our energies and also of those around us. </li>
<li>The third card is a bit more special and important as it offers a glimpse at the future. It doesn't promise an outcome – but clearly shows you a path you might be walking toward if things continue as they are.</li>
</ol>
Sometimes the cards appear upright. Sometimes reversed. Both matter. Both say something real.

</div>
<div>
<h2> Preparing for Your Three Card Reading</h2>
</div>
<div>
Before you begin, create a quiet space for yourself:
<ol>
<li>Take a few deep breaths to center your mind.</li>
<li>Let your question arise naturally—don’t force it.</li>
<li>Draw your three cards intuitively, without overthinking.</li>
<li>Reflect on the story that unfolds, one card at a time.</li>
</ol>
Remember—<a href="tarot">tarot</a> works best when you approach it with openness and honesty.

        ans: `We genuinely believe spiritual guidance shouldn't be a luxury item. We run on optional donations from users who find value (thank you to those amazing souls!) and some partnerships with ethical spiritual product companies. But the core tools? They stay free. Forever. No credit cards, no trials, no surprise charges. The only "catch" is that we ask you to approach the readings with genuine curiosity rather than expecting them to solve all your problems. Fair enough?`,

        ques: `Are digital tarot readings as accurate as offline readings?`,
        ans: `Digital tarot can't replicate human intuition. Period. But what it can do is provide authentic spiritual guidance based on traditional card meanings, your specific question, and cultural context that most generic sites completely miss.`,

    {
        ques: `How do I know the cards I get aren't just random?`,
        ans: `Emails or make calls. We don't even ask for your phone number. Your spiritual journey stays between you and the cards – that's how it should be.
The only data we collect is completely anonymous usage patterns that help us improve the platform. Think "people ask about career stuff more on Monday mornings" rather than "Priya from Pune asked about her job interview."

        ques: `Will my family/community accept this? I'm worried about cultural judgment.`,
        ans: `Oh, this hits close to home. We've heard from so many users who love the insights but worry about family reactions or community perception.This is what separates us from those terrible "tarot generators" that just spit out random cards with generic meanings. Our card selection process uses advanced randomization that mimics how cards naturally shuffle and fall in physical readings. We don't just generate three random numbers and call it a day. The system considers your question's emotional and spiritual context, prevents impossible card combinations that wouldn't occur in real readings, and ensures the spread tells a coherent story.
Plus, our algorithms have been trained on thousands of real readings specific to Indian life situations. So when you ask about family dynamics or career decisions, the system understands the cultural context behind your question. It's not perfect – no digital system is – but it's way more sophisticated than anything else available for free.

We literally cannot access your personal readings even if we wanted to (and we don't want to). We don't sell information to astrologers, marketing companies, or anyone else. We don't send spam 
That said, you know your family dynamics better than we do. Some of our users keep their tarot practice private, others have introduced parents and siblings to the platform. There's no right or wrong approach.
