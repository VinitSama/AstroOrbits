    {
        ques: `What's the deal with AstroOrbits? Why should I trust you guys over other horoscope websites?`,
        ans: `Look, we get it. Half the internet is using bots to churn out horoscopes these days. Cheap, fast, totally disconnected from actual jyotish. Here's what we do differently - real astrologers sit down and study your kundli properly for your daily horoscope today. No algorithms. No copy-paste bakwas. Just people who've been reading nakshatras and planetary positions for years.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is this free daily horoscope at AstroOrbits really free? What's the catch?`,
        ans: `Absolutely. Daily horoscope, weekly, monthly - everything is free. Even the effort intensive birth charts like complete janamkundli analysis and kundli milan are also entirely free.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `I have no clue what my rashi or zodiac sign is. Can you help me find my zodiac sign?`,
        ans: `Happens all the time! Just put your birth details into our Zodiac sign calculator - takes maybe 30 seconds. You'll get both your sun sign and chandra rashi (moon sign), because honestly, you need both for proper predictions.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Should I follow my sun sign or chandra rashi horoscope for daily predictions?`,
        ans: `Both matter, but differently. Your sun sign is your basic nature, your swabhav. Your chandra rashi is your emotional side - how you feel about things, what makes you happy or stressed. Check both for complete guidance.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `How do you know your horoscope predictions are accurate?`,
        ans: `Our astrologers use real graha positions / planetary positions where the planets actually are right now in the sky, not some generic template. Will it be 100% safe and accurate? Nothing is perfect. But it'll be way more personal than those AI horoscope apps everyone's using.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Can you make a personalized janamkundli for free just for me?`,
        ans: `Absolutely. Give us your date, place, and time of birth. In case you don’t know your accurate time of birth, you don't have to worry. We'll prepare your proper janampatri, Career rashifal, love life guidance, shubh muhurat - whatever's bothering you.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is my personal info safe when I get my free kundli?`,
        ans: `Of course. We're not selling your details or doing anything shady. What you share for your jyotish reading stays private.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Why should I check my cancer horoscope today or my daily rashifal?`,
        ans: `Because grahas / planets move every day. The moon changes position, other planets shift. A quick check of your daily rashifal helps you know if today's good for taking risks or if you should play it safe.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is jyotish and horoscope reading actually real?`,
        ans: `Jyotish and horoscope are ways to understand the larger patterns in our life. Some people find daily horoscopes helpful, some don't. Try it yourself.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What's this lagna or rising sign in my kundli?`,
        ans: `Your lagna is basically how the world sees you - your first impression before people get to know the real you. It changes every two hours, so you need exact birth time to figure out your udaya lagna.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `And what about the seventh house or kalatra bhava in astrology?`,
        ans: `The seventh house in your janamkundli shows what you're looking for in relationships - marriage partner, business partnerships, even close friendships. Explains why you click with some people and not others.`,
    },

export const horoscopeWeeklyFaqCard: IFAQCard[] = [
    {
        ques: `Should I follow my moon sign for weekly horoscope?`,
        ans: `Which sign you should choose for horoscope reading depends on what you are looking for in life as sun signs and moon signs reflect different aspects of your personalities and how you respond to your current phases in your life. For example, Your sun sign is your star personality as known to the masses, it’s how the world sees you, whereas your moon sign is your inner world, feelings, instincts, vulnerability. 

In Indian astrology, moon sign readings tend to highlight emotional rhythms which are essential for weekly horoscopes since weeks influence moods and intuitive waves more than just external traits.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Can weekly horoscopes actually help me make decisions?`,
        ans: `Weekly horoscopes can offer some guiding light. But think of them not as rulebooks but gentle nudges. They highlight favorable periods or cautionary signs, especially in relationships or work. 
Yet, your own judgment, experience, and common sense, those stay front and center. Astrology supports, it doesn’t command.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `When exactly do new weekly horoscopes come out?`,
        ans: `Expert astrologers with over 20 years of experience at AstroOrbits release them toward the weekend, Saturday or Sunday mostly, so you get a head start on the upcoming days. This timing lets you reflect over tea with your family, and near and dear ones, plan out your week, and maybe brace for any surprises.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What’s the real advantage of a personalized weekly horoscope?`,
        ans: `A generic weekly forecast casts a big brush, saying something about “all Leos” or “all Scorpios.” But a personalized weekly horoscope at AstroOrbits takes your birth details, exact time, place, and date of birth, at the helm of affairs, which changes interpretations drastically.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `How do expert astrologers prepare weekly horoscopes?`,
        ans: `Expert and certified vedic astrologers at AstroOrbits prepare a weekly horoscope by checking where the planets are hanging out right as the week begins. Then, they look at how these planets 'communicate " or "affect " with one another; these interactions, called aspects, bring friendlier or tense vibes. 

AstroOrbits also keeps a close eye on the Moon’s journey through 27 nakshatras; these lunar mansions signal emotional and mental shifts. They factor in the Panchanga parts like Tithi (the lunar day), Vara (day of week), Yoga (combined planetary effects), and Karana (half-day segments).`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Why do my friend’s horoscopes sometimes say different things than mine even though we have the same Zodiac sign?`,
        ans: `Because at AstroOrbits, every prediction / reading you get is personalised, and especially curated for the person on the basis of his/ her date of birth, place of birth, and time of birth.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What does my weekly horoscope forecast cover?`,
        ans: `Your weekly horoscope forecast covers all the major areas and aspects in your life. For example, AstroOrbits weekly horoscope forecast covers the following:
        <ul>
        <li>Career Forecast</li>
        <li>Love horoscope</li> 
        <li>Finance predictions</li>
        <li>Family horoscope</li>
        <ul>`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Any advice at all on how to take these weekly horoscopes?`,
        ans: `Don’t treat these readings like some infallible script. The stars might hint here and there, but remember stuff like doctor’s orders or money matters? Those don’t come from the stars, they come from real-life experts in their respective fields. So never toss those aside just because the cosmos says something else. Life is messy, and while the stars might show you tides and winds, you’re the one holding the rudder. So use these readings as guides, not gospel.`,
    },

export const horoscopeHealthFaqCard: IFAQCard[] = [
    {
        ques: `What’s a health horoscope all about?`,
        ans: `A health horoscope provides you insights into your general well being on the basis of date of birth, place of birth and time of birth. Its predictions are based on the planetary positions in your birth chart/ kundli, your dasha, doshas, and your karmic relations. The health horoscope tells you as to what you can expect and how to take precautions.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Can astrology actually reveal health clues?`,
        ans: `Astrology can highlight tendencies or patterns, for instance, times when stress might affect you more, but it doesn’t diagnose illnesses. Think of it as one more tool that helps you stay mindful and proactive.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Which parts of the birth chart matter for health?`,
        ans: `The 6th, 8th, and 12th houses in a birth chart are directly related to health, healing, and challenges. Moreover, planetary movements also play a crucial role in this.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Why do planets affect our health?`,
        ans: `Because each of the planets in the solar system are associated with certain organs, and hence ailments related to those organs.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is it risky to follow astrology instead of medicine?`,
        ans: `You should never replace your medicine with Astrology. Rather, the combination of Astrology and modern medicine is what yields better results.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What kind of remedies does astrology suggest?`,
        ans: `This depends on the kind of problem you face in life. Remedies are always problem specific and personalised as per you Kundli.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Should I tell my doctor if I use astrology?`,
        ans: `Of course you can share it with your doctor. Astrology is like a science like medicine.`,

    title: "What Exactly Is a Daily Horoscope?",
    column1: `
<div>
    A daily horoscope is not a strict prediction, and it’s not about changing your fate, whether you go by Vedic astrology or even the Western concept of rising or descendant signs. Think of it as a friendly heads-up based on how the nine planets (Navagraha), the Moon’s ride through the nakshatras, and all those cosmic movements color the mood of your day.
</div>
<div>
    What sets a daily horoscope apart from monthly or yearly ones is its immediacy. Life changes day to day—the little things, the moods, the timing of meetings, that spontaneous urge to call a friend. The sky changes quickly, and a daily horoscope keeps you tuned in to those shifting currents.
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Why You Should Read Your Daily Horoscope at AstroOrbits</h2>
    At AstroOrbits, we pay close attention to each detail, to each house in your kundli, and each planetary movement on a daily basis so that you get an entirely personalised and <u>AI-free, human-written horoscope</u> for your zodiac sign. You get accurately prepared daily horoscopes for all the zodiac signs as per Vedic daily horoscope prediction, encompassing:
</div>
<div>
    <ol>
    <li> <strong>The Navagraha</strong>, or nine planets—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu—and how they’re moving through the zodiac.<br><br></li>

    <li> <strong>The Nakshatras</strong>, those 27 lunar mansions that tell us more about your emotional ebb and flow.<br><br></li>

    <li> Special factors like <strong>retrogrades, planetary aspects</strong> (when planets “look” at each other in the chart), and the four pillars of the Panchanga (tithi, vara, yoga, karana).<br><br></li>
    </ol>
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Benefits of Reading Your Daily Horoscope Today:</h2>
</div>
<div>
<ol>
    <li> <strong>Clarity:</strong> Sometimes we wake up feeling a bit off and wonder what’s going on. Checking your horoscope daily can bring clarity. It helps you understand why communication might feel bumpy when Mercury is in retrograde, or why you suddenly have extra pep in your step when Mars energises your sign.<br><br>

    Irrespective of your zodiac sign, reading your today’s horoscope enables you to see the day with a tint of clarity coming from the planetary movements and their alignments.<br><br></li>

    <li> <strong>Plan, Not Just Predict:</strong> Daily horoscope reading acts like a navigational map for you. You can forecast, if not the exact events, then at least the preludes to those events. It can be a great benefit as it helps you plan the entire day accordingly.<br><br>

    For example, if a reader is about to sign a deal on one fine day, the daily horoscope predictions become of great significance as they act as a guiding shield, helping you make important decisions effortlessly.<br><br></li>

    <li><strong>Forecast for your emotions:</strong> Maybe the celestial forecast suggests it’s a day for patience, or that your intuition will be on point. That cue might make you rethink snapping at someone or might inspire you to follow a hunch you’d usually ignore.<br><br></li>

    <li> <strong>A Fountainhead of Motivation:</strong> Daily horoscopes are of great significance as they show you how you can be a conqueror every day by just adjusting your actions as per the planetary positions of the day. Everyone has slow days. A daily horoscope becomes a source of motivation as it tells you what to do and what to avoid. Seeing a little encouragement or a gentle heads-up in the morning can boost motivation, or help you relax, trusting in cosmic timing.<br><br></li>

    <li> <strong>A Reminder to Pause & Retrospect:</strong> Daily horoscopes do not only tell you what to do and what to avoid; they even tell you when to take a pause, introspect, and think of a strategy for the future as per the planetary alignment of the day. Even if life is a whirlwind, these few minutes with your horoscope are a check-in—with the universe and with yourself.<br><br></li>

    <li><strong> Belongingness:</strong> There’s something special about knowing millions of others are also reading their signs. It reminds us we’re all under the same sky, navigating different yet similar stories.<br></li>

    <h2> Daily vs. Weekly or Monthly Horoscopes</h2>
    Some days are so unique that only a daily horoscope can capture them. You notice it when a plan falls into place suddenly or when moods shift out of nowhere. The daily rhythm of the planets affects our moods, opportunities, even simple interactions at the chai stall or in a traffic jam.
</div>
<div>
    At AstroOrbits, you get daily horoscopes, weekly horoscopes, and monthly horoscopes. All these horoscopes are crafted with due care, and attention is paid even to minute details in all the houses of your birth chart. Planetary movements are analysed and polished into actionable insights by our expert astrologers.

</div>
<div> You should not see a daily horoscope as an alternative to a weekly or monthly horoscope. Rather, all these three horoscopes should be seen as complementary to each other.
</div>
<div>
    <h2> How to Make Daily Horoscope Reading a Practice</h2>
    A horoscope isn’t magic or a cast-in-stone dictate; it’s just a tool, and like any tool, it needs your touch. Here’s how to turn your reading into real-life wisdom:
</div>
<div>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Begin each morning or evening with a glance at your sign’s reading. Ask yourself, “How does this feel for me?”</li>
    <li><strong>Patterns:</strong> Jot down a quick note or two, energy high or low, smooth or rough conversations? Over a week, you’ll see where the stars genuinely sync (and when they’re just background music).</li>
    <li><strong>Tips & Remedies for the day:</strong> If your reading says, “Take a mindful pause,” actually do it. Try the mantra, make that call, or give someone an honest compliment. Small actions add up.</li>
    <li><strong>Share and Discuss:</strong> Horoscope conversations make for great bonding, family breakfast, best friends on WhatsApp, or even colleagues at lunch.</li>
    <li><strong>Introspection:</strong> Before bed, ask yourself if you felt the horoscope’s influence. It’s a simple way to wind down and connect with yourself.</li>
    <li><strong>Seek Help:</strong> If you feel confused, don’t hold yourself back. Seek help from AstroOrbits’ free personalised kundli analysis and free numerology services. Just enter your date of birth, place of birth, and time of birth, and let the magic of your free personalised predictions unfold before your eyes within 30 seconds.</li>

    <h2> Personalised Weekly Horoscope: How We Prepare Free Horoscope Report: </h2>
</div>
<div>
    AstroOrbits’ certified vedic astrologers meticulously prepare personalised horoscopes for all 12 zodiac signs, and provide <strong>Vedic astrology online </strong>horoscopes for free. Our horoscopes are not only based on the moon’s changing position, and its effects on each zodiac sign, but also utilise various charts and methods used in vedic astrology like the <strong>kundli calculator</strong>. 
</div>
<div>
    <h3> Step 1: Detailed Planetary Analysis</h3>
    Our verified vedic astrologers observe the daily and weekly effects of the nine celestial bodies or navagraha. Our experts perform a detailed <strong>navagraha reading which includes all the planets of vedic astrology pantheon like</strong> the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu CASCADE. Even just a small twist of these planets can cause differences in mood, energy, and manifestations, so these are at the base of our <strong>Vedic astrology weekly forecast</strong>,
</div>
    `,
    column2: `
<div>
    <h3> Step 2: Moon & Nakshatra's Assessment:</h3>
    Our expert astrologer predictions considers all the 27 nakshatras mentioned in vedic astrology for accurate and personalised weekly horoscope readings. Since the Moon governs our emotions, we want to know what it’s doing as it travels through the 27 nakshatras (lunar mansions). This is why <strong>our expert astrologer predictions</strong> are read all across India, USA, Europe and Australia. 
</div>
<div>
    <h3> Step 3: Panchanga Study</h3>
    We deduce five components of <a href="/panchang">Panchanga</a>, those are: 
    Tithi (Lunar day)
    Vara (Week day)
    Yoga (Planetary combination)
    Karana (Half day part)
    Nakshatra. 
</div>
<div>
    These particulars help us find the best times, beneficial successes, and effective curative measures for each sign, making our <strong>moon sign horoscope</strong> and <strong>sun sign horoscope</strong> accurate and relatable for all the 12 zodiac signs, and people from all walks of life. 
</div>
<div>
    <h3> Step 4: Factors & Retrogrades </h3>
    Our astrologers also consider how planets cast their aspects (graha drishti) with each other and they study retrogrades. These commonly account for sudden changes, such as delays during Mercury retrograde or a surge of desires when Mars is potent. Our natal chart analysts perform these <strong>detailed planetary analysis</strong> and <strong>navagraha readings</strong> to make <strong>vedic astrology weekly forecast</strong>. 
</div>
<div>
    <h3> Step 5: Relating to Zodiac Traits</h3>
    After the full planetary picture is revealed, we then take the information and place it in the make-up of the zodiac sign it’s in. A Mars transit in Virgo, for instance, will carry very different effects for Virgo than it will for Aries or Scorpio. This ensures every horoscope is specific and relevant, not vague.

<div>
<u><em>Venus – The Planet Riding The Love Tide</em></u>
</div>
<div>
Each zodiac sign has its own way of loving. Taurus and Libra, ruled by Venus, often wear their hearts on their sleeves. But love isn’t reserved for just those signs. Your love horoscope recognizes that passion, loyalty, and emotional connection can live in every sign — from a dreamy Pisces to an intense Scorpio or a grounded Capricorn.
</div>
<div>
It all depends on where Venus sits in your birth chart and what other planetary energies it's mingling with. When Venus aligns well (say, with Saturn, Mercury, or Pisces), your love life tends to bloom. When it’s in a challenging position, it could bring emotional misunderstandings, distance, or confusion. That’s why daily planetary tracking matters and that’s exactly what we do at AstroOrbits.

    title: "Finance Horoscope Today – How zodiac signs affect financial success",
    column1: `
<div>
One of the common aspects among all the Zodiac signs in western astrology (Finance Natal Chart & Money Tarot Card Predictions) as well as in Indian Vedic Astrology (<a href="kundli">Kundali</a>/ Kundli and Dhan Prapti Yog) is that individuals want to amass wealth to the best of their abilities and safeguard their financial lives to lead a happy and comfortable lifestyle. 
</div>
<div>
<h2> Hard Work vs. Smart Work – But What About Planetary Work?</h2>
All these Zodiac signs work extremely hard to ensure they get what they aspire to. But, not all of them succeed at what they aim for: Financial Independence, wealth abundance, and money. And those who do succeed, have two major reasons for that. The first one is just a one-size fits all approach, wherein the second reason speaks volumes as to how Finance Horoscope plays a crucial role in an individual's money matters. 
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><h3>Hard Work, or rather Smart Work explanation:</h3>
This reason is as vague as the saying that a pigeon with its eyes being shut could escape the wrath of a fierce cat. Evaluation entirely based on hard work or smart work is not scientific as there are reasons and circumstances which run beyond hard work or smart work dilemma. This is not to say that hard work doesn't count in a person’s financial life. It definitely does, but it's not always the only factor furthering the financial lives of all <a href="horoscope/Finance">Zodiac Signs.</a>  </li>
</div>
<div>
<li><h3>Accurate, AI-free and Personalised Finance predictions:</h3>
Another reason which definitely plays a pivotal role in an individual’s rise in his/her financial life is AI-free, accurate and personalised Astrological <a href="horoscope/Finance">Predictions for Money and Finance</a>. Do you know that without you even knowing, the positions of celestial bodies like the Sun, Moon, Jupiter and Venus determine the roadmap of your financial lives?</li>
</ol>
</div>
    `,
    column2: `
<h2> Your Financial Predictions with Daily Finance Horoscope – Is it even helpful? </h2>
</div>
<div>
Well, the answer depends on what kind of wealth forecasting by zodiac sign you are relying upon. If you read AI-generated money tarot guidance, it's good for nothing, not at all worth your time. When your financial problems  are real, you should look for planetary alignment for wealth. What’s the point of relying upon AI-generated vague financial predictions? 
</div>
<div>
<h2> So what should you do? </h2>
Stick with real, human-written financial horoscopes. Ones that don’t treat astrology like a guessing game. Ones that respect your lived reality and offer guidance based on ancient wisdom — not a random algorithm. Since your financial problems are real and stem from real life circumstances, the only reliable way is to read financial predictions, money kundali, and finance horoscopes daily.

<h3> Wondering where to get 100% AI-free, real human-driven finance horoscope predictions? </h3>

<li><strong>Financial risks</strong> and how to avoid potential setbacks.</li>

<h2>Real Talk, Planet-Wise</h2>
You don’t need to blindly believe in astrology. Just observe.
Daily career horoscopes, weekly career horoscopes, and monthly career horoscopes guide you by observing the cosmic forces, especially Saturn, the planet that governs career, karma, and discipline. Its placement in your chart often reveals more about your work ethic, timing of promotions, and even the right industries or roles for you.
</div>
<div>
There are days everything flows, and then days when even replying to one email feels like climbing a mountain. Astrology doesn’t control you, but it explains why you feel what you feel. Saturn could be slowing you down. Mercury might be messing with communication. Jupiter could be opening a new door quite quietly. And the best way to know what’s in for your career horoscope wise? Its reading your personalised career horoscope.
