    {
        ques: `What exactly is this Kundli matching thing and why do families insist on it?`,
        ans: `Kundli matching is this ancient practice where astrologers compare your birth chart with your potential partner's chart. Think of it like... you know how some people check compatibility through personality tests? This is the Indian astrological version of that.

Our experts look at 8 different aspects - like whether you'll get along mentally, how your temperaments match, even physical compatibility (yeah, they go there!).`,
    },
    {
        ques: `So how many points do I actually need for my parents to stop freaking out?`,
        ans: `Haha, we love how people put this! Look, traditionally families want at least 18 out of 36 points. But here's the thing - we've seen families celebrate 25+ points like they won the lottery, while others panic over 20 points. Here's the real breakdown:
        <ul> 
<li>If you get 32-36, your families will probably start planning the wedding immediately.</li> 
<li>25-31 is pretty solid, most astrologers give it a thumbs up.</li> 
<li>18-24 is decent - it means you'll need to put in some effort, but hey, which marriage doesn't? </li>
<li>Below 18... well, that's when families start looking for remedies or second opinions. </li>
</ul>
But honestly? We know couples with 15 points who've been happily married for decades. It's not the end of the world.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `I'm Manglik - should I be worried about ruining my partner's life?`,
        ans: `Being Manglik just means Mars was in certain positions when you were born. Yes, it can make you a bit more... let's say passionate or argumentative. But millions of Manglik people are living perfectly happy, normal lives with their spouses. 

The whole "Manglik will cause partner's death" thing is honestly quite outdated and extreme. Modern astrology looks at your entire chart, not just Mars. So breathe, okay? It's manageable.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Can a Manglik person marry a non-Manglik person?`,
        ans: `We know traditional advice often says "Manglik should only marry Manglik," but that's not always practical, right? Plus, our team has learned that compatibility depends on the overall chart analysis, not just Mars placement.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What is the difference between Ashtakoota and Dashkoota matching?`,
        ans: `Ashtakoota is the standard 8-factor compatibility system that gives you that famous score out of 36 points. It analyzes:
        <ul>
<li>Varna</li>
<li>Vashya</li>
<li>Tara</li>
<li>Yoni</li>
<li>Graha Maitri</li>
<li>Gana</li>
<li>Bhakoot</li>
<li>Nadi</li></ul><br>
Dashkoota is like the premium version - it's an extended 10-factor system that includes additional aspects like
<ul>
<li>Dina</li>
<li>Mahendra</li>
<li>Stree Deergha</li>
<li>Rajju</li>
<li>Vedha</li></ul>`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Which factors are most important in Kundli matching?`,
        ans: `From our experience analyzing thousands of matches, the most critical factors are:
        <ul> 
<li>Nadi (8 points) - this affects health and children
<li>Bhakoot (7 points) - impacts your emotional and financial stability together
<li>Gana (6 points) - determines whether your personalities will clash or mesh well. 
<li>Yoni (4 points) for physical compatibility
<li>Graha Maitri (5 points) for mental compatibility are also super important.
</ul>`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is Kundli matching still relevant in love marriages?`,
        ans: `kundli matching can still give you insights into areas you might not have explored yet. Like, how will you handle money together? What about when kids come along? How will you deal with health issues or family pressures down the road? It's like having a crystal ball for your future challenges and strengths. 

Plus, if both families are into astrology, it can definitely help smooth things over with the parents! We always tell couples - think of it as extra information, not the deciding factor.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `How long does kundli matching take?`,
        ans: `AstroOrbits online matching gives instant results, complete report with personalized insights.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Is 16 Gun Milan enough for marriage?`,
        ans: `16 points is below the traditional minimum of 18, but hey, we've guided couples with 16 points to successful marriages! You'll just need extra effort and some remedies.`,
    },
    {
        ques: `What happens if Kundlis don't match at all?`,
        ans: `Very low scores indicate challenges for sure, but couples can still marry with proper remedies, counseling, and genuine commitment. We've seen it work!`,
    },
    {
        ques: `Can kundli matching be wrong?`,
        ans: `Accuracy totally depends on correct birth details and astrologer expertise. Wrong birth time can definitely mess up results - that's why we always double-check!`,

<h2> The 36-Point System – Why the Hype?</h2>
</div>
<div>
Your grandmother may call it ‘Gun Milan’, your astrologer friend may refer to it as horoscope matching.
</div>
<div>
Traditional Kundli matching uses 36 points, or Gunas, from 8 different categories. Each one evaluates a different part of your relationship:
<ul>
<li><strong> Varna (1 point)</strong>  – Are you mentally on the same wavelength?</li>
<li><strong> Vashya (2 points)</strong>  – Who’s the natural leader in the relationship?</li>
<li><strong> Tara (3 points)</strong>  – Will you both stay healthy and happy?</li>
<li><strong> Yoni (4 points)</strong>  – Yes, this is about physical compatibility.</li>
<li><strong> Graha Maitri (5 </strong> points) – Can you be friends as well as partners?</li>
<li><strong> Gana (6 points)</strong>  – Do your personalities mesh well?</li>
<li><strong> Bhakoot (7 points)</strong>  – How deep is your emotional connection?</li>
<li><strong> Nadi (8 points)</strong>  – Can you build a healthy family together?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Here’s how the scoring breaks down:</strong>
</div>
<div>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
  <thead>
    <tr>

      <td>25 - 31</td>
      <td>Pretty Good</td>
      <td>Most astrologers will agree</td>

<div>

The old belief is that if you're Manglik, you should marry another Manglik, or else bad things will happen to your spouse.
Sounds daunting, right? But here’s the truth, millions of Mangliks are happily married to non-Mangliks. Being aware of this and taking steps if needed is the key.

<h3> Case Study: Manglik Resolution</h3>
Rani is a manglik girl from Patna. Her astrologer predicted that she could only marry another Manglik. AstroOrbits came forward and showed her the true path. We identified that her Mars was well-placed in the 8th house. It means that her manglik effect was being cancelled. As a result, we told her and her family that she could marry whoever she wanted to. Rani just conceived her first baby in January 2025.

<strong>Our Promise:</strong> Your personal birth details are treated with complete confidentiality — encrypted, never shared, and only used to generate your compatibility report. 
</div>
<div>
Our Kundli Matching analysis is based on time-tested principles from classical Vedic texts including:
<ol>
<li>Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra - The foundational text for Vedic astrology principles</li>
<li>Jataka Parijata - Classical work on marriage compatibility by Vaidyanatha Dixit</li>
<li>Hora Sara - Ancient text detailing planetary influences on relationships</li>
<li>Saravali - Comprehensive guide to astrological combinations by Kalyana Varma</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h3> Two Ways to Match Your Kundli<h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Name-Based Matching – Quick and simple. It uses just your names to give a rough idea of compatibility. It’s not super precise, but it’s better than nothing.</li>
<li>Birth Details Matching – This one’s more detailed. It uses your exact birth time, date, and place, making it far more reliable.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
Most couples who are serious about it go with the second option, unless they don’t know their birth time, in which case the name-based method is better than no matching at all.
</div>
<div>
<h2> What If Our Kundlis Don’t Match?</h2>
</div>
<div>
First of all, don’t panic. Low compatibility doesn’t mean the end of the road.
Remember that couple with only 15 points who’ve been married for 50 years? They knew they were different, so they worked hard on understanding and accepting each other. Relationships are about effort, no matter the stars.
</div>
<div>
<h3> Our Experts Insights for you:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discuss. Are you ready to handle those differences?</li>
<li>Get expert advice: A good astrologer can suggest remedies. Some might involve simple rituals, while others may suggest changes in how you interact with each other.</li>
<li>Focus on real compatibility: Do you share values? Do you make each other laugh? Do you want the same things out of life? These might matter more than planetary positions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Expert Insights:</strong> In our consultations, we’ve seen couples with just 15-16 points thrive because they focused on communication, shared values, and effort. Kundli matching highlights tendencies, but real compatibility is built day by day.
</div>
<div>

<h3> Online Matching vs Meeting an Astrologer</h3>
</div>
<div>
Online tools for kundli matching are useful for:
<ul>
<li>Quick compatibility checks</li>
<li>Comparing multiple potential partners</li>
<li>Getting basic compatibility scores</li>
<li>Understanding how the process works</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

But you should see a real astrologer when:
<ul>
<li>Your score is below 18</li>
<li>Serious Doshas are present</li>
<li>You need specific remedies</li>
<li>You’re deciding on wedding dates</li>
<li>Your families are at odds over the results</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>

<h3>Debunking Some Common Myths</h3>
<ul>
<li>“If our Kundlis don’t match, we can’t get married” </li>
<li>“Kundli matching is only for arranged marriages” – Wrong. Many couples in love marriages also use it. Better safe than sorry.</li>
<li>“This is outdated nonsense” – Maybe. But relationship compatibility isn’t nonsense. The method may be ancient, but the goal is still relevant.</li>
<li>“Perfect Kundli match = perfect marriage” – If only it were that simple! Matching Kundlis is like laying a solid foundation, but you still need to build the house.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Real Talk</h2>

</div>
<div>
<h2> Making It Work Despite Low Scores</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be upfront about money. Talk about it before getting married.</li>
<li>Sort out who will do what in terms of household chores. </li>
<li>Be honest about your annoying habits. </li>
<li>Don’t wait for your spouse to find them out the hard way.</li>
