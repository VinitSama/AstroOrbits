        <h3> What Your <strong>love compatibility score</strong> Means</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        Think of <strong>free compatibility test online and birth date compatibility analysis</strong> percentage as a conversation starter, not a verdict:
        <ul>
            <li>80%+ Natural Harmony<br>
            You share strong <strong>planetary compatibility (graha milan)</strong> and emotional resonance and aligned life goals, enjoy the synergy!</li>

            <li>Below 50% Bridging Differences<br>
            Opposites attract, and there’s magic in learning from each other. Communication and empathy are your tools here.</li>

        <h3> What It Tells You</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
        The <strong>numerology match calculation</strong> isn’t some romantic verdict. Think of <strong>Name compatibility calculator as a doorway</strong>. A score over 80% usually means natural chemistry and mutual understanding. If it’s somewhere in the middle, it could mean you’ve got potential, especially if you’re both willing to grow. And if the number’s low? That doesn’t mean your love is doomed. Some of the strongest relationships are between opposites who’ve learned to bridge gaps.
