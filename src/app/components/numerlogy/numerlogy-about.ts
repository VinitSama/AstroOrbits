        <h3> Example: How Numbers Speak</h3>
        When Priya (DOB: 17th July) used our calculator, her Life Path Number was revealed as 8, which is the number of Saturn. She had always liked careers of responsibility and discipline, but also faced struggles with financial delays. Numerology gave her clarity to embrace her strength as a leader while learning patience with Saturn’s lessons.
</div>
<div>
        <h2> The Core Numbers That Shape Your Life</h2>
        Numerology is a game of numbers wherein all the numbers associated with various aspects of your life like date of birth, time of birth, phone number, house number, and bank account number etc are taken into consideration to arrive at astrological predictions and make well-informed decisions.
        <ul>
                <li>Life Path Number: Your destiny’s blueprint</li>
                <li>Expression Number: Your natural talents and outward personality</li>
                <li>Soul Urge Number: Your inner desires and emotional compass</li>
                <li>Karmic Number: Lessons you’re here to learn</li>
                <li>Birthday Number: Special traits gifted to you at birth</li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div>
        Example: Someone born on 29th August carries the energy of 2+9=11, a Master Number. People with 11 often have deep intuition and spiritual insight, but also face inner conflicts between logic and intuition.

        <h2> Types of Numerology: </h2>
        From the time a baby is born to the time of demise, numerology plays a crucial role in how numbers determine the trajectory of our lives. Whether it's about your health, career, finance or love and relationships – numerology provides answers to each of these aspects based on the various kinds of numbers and their astronomical calculations like Karmic cycle number, Life Path Number, Sun Number, and Moon numbers, among others. 
</div>
<div>
        Numerology is often dubbed as the game of numbers and their vibrations. While this sentence is not wrong, Numerology as an ancient school of astrological science transcends beyond the vile of numbers and their effects. While Numerology is a science that begets importance in today’s day and age, it also assists expert numerologists in their prediction of an individual’s various aspects of life like health numerology, finance numerology, career numerology, love numerology and name numerology. 
</div>
<div>
        The range of numbers in this astrological science is between 1 and 9. In other words, irrespective of the number digits, the numbers are brought into the scale of single digit numbers, except zero, using additions. 
</div>
<div>
        Since time immemorial, Numerology has been an integral part of all the great civilizations in the world. Ancient civilisations like Harappan civilisation and Inca civilisation, and countries like Greece, Japan, Rome, China and central asian nations, all have had rich traditions of numerology and numerology predictions. 
</div>
<div>
        The result? These great civilisations and their rich numerology traditions have given the world impeccable branches of numerology. 
</div>
<div>
        Each of these numerology branches or types of numerology are known for their respective attributes and how these attributes provide answers to some of the most complex problems in our lives. 
</div>
<div>
        <ol>
                <li>Pythagorean Numerology: This branch of numerology is also called Western numerology because of its origins in the calculations of Greek Mathematics and the teachings of the great philosopher Pythagoras. This branch places significant emphasis on the numbers ranging between 1 and 9 and numerical value of alphabets. This branch of numerology focuses on the date of birth and name of a person to determine the life path number.<br><br>
                Applications of Pythagorean Numerology

                </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Chaldean Numerology: Originating in the Babylonian culture of the middle east, the Chaldean numerology stands as one of the oldest and trusted branches of Numerologi across the world. This branch of numerology does not use the number 9 in its calculations. Rather its the vibrational energy assigned to letters and numbers which become the base for prediction. <br><br>
                Unique Aspects of Chaldean Numerology: 
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>Uses numbers 1-8 (excludes 9)</li>

                <li>Mystical interpretations</li>
                </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Vedic Numerology or South Indian numerology: This tradition stems from the ancient hindu scriptures like the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, and birth charts (Kundali/ Kundli) and is quite popular across India. Due to its extensive use in South India, this branch of numerology is also called Tamil Numerology. Date of birth and name are used to arrive at the numerological calculations like psychic numbers, destiny number and life path number, giving numerological insights to all aspects of life.<br><br>

                Key Features Of Vedic Numerology:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Chinese Numerology: As the  name suggests, this branch of numerology first emerged from China, and then spread across the world over centuries. Chinese silk trades and scholars were the main proponents of Chinese numerology. As they travelled across countries, with them they took Chinese numerology and helped people in their host countries. Based on energy flow (Qi) and Taoist philosophy, some scholars also claim that Chinese numerology is actually Tibetan Numerology. Nonetheless, the Chinese numerology traditions provide great insights into finding lucky dates and the positive energy associated with specific numbers.<br><br> 

                Key Elements of Chinese Numerology:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                </ul><br>
                </li>

                <li>Kabbalistic Numerology or Jewish Numerology: This numerology depends on Hebrew alphabets. Although the tradition is dying, there are specific pockets of the world, particularly in the middle east and Israel, wherein this tradition is still thriving.
